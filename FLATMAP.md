## Why `flatMap` Doesn't Automatically Parallelize Inner Work

`flatMap`'s core design focuses on transforming items into asynchronous sequences (`Publisher`s) and managing their concurrent execution and merging, rather than dictating the specific threading model for the inner work itself. Here's why:

1.  **Respecting the Execution Context:**
    *   Project Reactor generally follows the principle of executing work on the thread provided by the upstream operator or the subscribing thread, *unless explicitly told otherwise* using operators like `publishOn` or `subscribeOn`.
    *   `flatMap` adheres to this. The thread on which the inner `Publisher` (e.g., `Mono.fromCallable`) is *subscribed to* by `flatMap` determines where its work initially runs, unless that inner publisher itself specifies a different scheduler. `flatMap` doesn't impose its own threading model onto the inner publisher's execution.

2.  **Flexibility and Control:**
    *   Automatically forcing parallelism might not always be desirable or efficient.
    *   The inner operations might be very lightweight, making the overhead of thread switching unnecessary.
    *   Sometimes, inner operations *need* to run sequentially or on a specific thread for correctness (e.g., accessing thread-confined resources).
    *   Forcing parallelism could introduce complexity or bugs in such scenarios.

3.  **Explicit Control via Schedulers:**
    *   Reactor provides dedicated operators (`subscribeOn`, `publishOn`) for precise control over the execution context (threading).
    *   This separation of concerns allows developers to explicitly choose *where* different parts of their reactive chain execute.
    *   `flatMap` relies on these standard mechanisms rather than implementing its own implicit scheduling for the inner publishers.

**How Parallelism is Achieved *with* `flatMap`:**

Parallelism when using `flatMap` typically comes from the combination of:

1.  **`flatMap`'s `concurrency` Parameter:** This allows multiple inner publishers to be subscribed to and active *at the same time*.
2.  **Schedulers (`subscribeOn` / `publishOn`):** You use these operators to explicitly place the execution of the inner publishers onto a suitable thread pool (like `Schedulers.parallel()` or `Schedulers.boundedElastic()`).
    *   Often, a `subscribeOn` placed *before* `flatMap` (or high up the chain) influences the thread where `flatMap` subscribes to the inner publishers, thus influencing where their work runs (as seen in your `fluxWithOnlySubscribeOn` example).
    *   Alternatively, `publishOn` can be used *inside* the `flatMap` mapping function on the inner publisher (`Mono.fromCallable { ... }.publishOn(...)`) to shift *that specific inner work* to a different scheduler.

In essence, `flatMap` provides the *structure* and *potential* for concurrency, but you use Reactor's standard scheduling operators (`subscribeOn

## Why `flatMap` Inner Publishers Don't Run in Parallel Automatically

Think of `flatMap` like a **Project Manager** assigning tasks based on incoming requests.

1.  **Receiving Requests:** The Project Manager (`flatMap`) receives incoming requests (items from the upstream `Publisher`).

2.  **Creating Task Plans:** For each request, the Manager creates a *plan* for a new task (the inner `Publisher`, like a `Mono` or `Flux`, returned by your mapping function). This plan outlines *what* needs to be done.

3.  **Assigning Tasks (Subscribing):** The Manager assigns these task plans to available workers (subscribes to the inner publishers). The `concurrency` parameter tells the Manager how many workers can be actively working on assigned tasks simultaneously.

4.  **The Crucial Point - *How* the Task is Done:** The Project Manager (`flatMap`) **doesn't dictate *how* each individual worker performs their assigned task**.
    *   Does the worker need special tools only available in one workshop (a specific `Scheduler`)?
    *   Can the worker do the task right at their desk (the current thread)?
    *   Does the task itself involve waiting for something else?

    `flatMap` respects the instructions given *within* the task plan (the inner `Publisher`) or the general workshop rules (the default `Scheduler` context it inherits). It doesn't automatically grab every worker and force them into a "parallel processing room" just because it's managing multiple tasks.

5.  **Why Not Automatic Parallelism?**
    *   **Flexibility:** Some tasks *shouldn't* run in parallel or need specific environments (threads/schedulers). Forcing parallelism could break things or be inefficient (e.g., very quick tasks don't benefit from thread switching overhead).
    *   **Explicit Control:** Reactor provides specific tools (`subscribeOn`, `publishOn`) to explicitly tell a task *where* and *how* it should run (which workshop/thread pool). This keeps the control clear and deliberate. `flatMap` focuses on the *coordination* and *merging* of these potentially independent tasks.
    *   **Respecting Context:** It follows Reactor's principle of generally running work in the current context unless explicitly shifted.

6.  **Collecting Results:** As each worker completes their task (the inner publisher emits), they report back to the Project Manager (`flatMap`). The Manager collects these results as they come in (merging) and passes them on.

**In short:** `flatMap` manages the *concurrent assignment* and *result merging* of tasks derived from upstream

## Why the Inner `flatMap` Scheduler's Influence Persists

The key is understanding that `flatMap` **merges** the results from its inner publishers **as they arrive**, and it passes these results downstream **on the threads they arrived on**.

Here's the flow:

1.  **`flatMap` Creates and Subscribes to Inner Publishers:**
    *   When `flatMap` receives an item from upstream, your mapping function creates a *new, independent* inner `Publisher` (e.g., `Mono.fromCallable { task(value) }`).
    *   This inner `Publisher` might have its own scheduling operator:
        *   `.subscribeOn(schedulerX)`: Dictates that the subscription to *this specific inner Mono* and the execution of its source (`task(value)`) should happen on a thread from `schedulerX`.
        *   `.publishOn(schedulerY)`: Dictates that while the source (`task(value)`) might run on the thread `flatMap` subscribed on, the *result* (`onNext` signal) emitted by *this specific inner Mono* should be delivered on a thread from `schedulerY`.

2.  **Inner Publisher Emits on its Designated Thread:**
    *   Based on the `subscribeOn` or `publishOn` applied *inside* the mapping function, the inner `Mono` emits its result (`onNext` signal with the computed value) on a specific thread (`schedulerX` or `schedulerY`).

3.  **`flatMap` Receives and Merges Results:**
    *   `flatMap` acts as a collector. It receives the `onNext` signals from *all* its active inner publishers.
    *   Crucially, it receives these signals **on the threads they were emitted on** by the inner publishers (i.e., on `schedulerX` or `schedulerY` threads in our examples).

4.  **`flatMap` Forwards Results Downstream:**
    *   As `flatMap` receives these results, it immediately forwards them downstream to the next operator in the chain.
    *   It forwards them **on the same thread they arrived on**. `flatMap` itself doesn't inherently change the thread context of the results it's merging.

5.  **Subsequent Operators Receive on Those Threads:**
    *   The operator immediately *after* `flatMap` (e.g., another `.publishOn()` or the final `.subscribe()` block) receives the merged items on the threads they arrived on from `flatMap` (which were determined by the inner publishers' schedulers).

6.  **Subsequent `publishOn` Takes Over (If Present):**
    *   If you have another `.publishOn(schedulerZ)` *after* the `flatMap`, *that* operator will then intercept the items arriving on `schedulerX`/`schedulerY` threads and explicitly shift their processing further downstream onto its specified scheduler (`schedulerZ`).

**Analogy:**

*   Think of `flatMap` as a central dispatch office.
*   It sends out work orders (the inner `Mono`s) to different workshops.
*   Each work order might specify:
    *   Which workshop should do the work (`subscribeOn` inside).
    *   Which delivery truck (thread) should bring back the finished product (`publishOn` inside).
*   The dispatch office (`flatMap`) receives the finished products via various delivery trucks (threads).
*   It immediately puts these products onto an outbound conveyor belt (`flatMap`'s output) *using the same delivery truck (thread) that brought them in*.
*   The next station down the line receives products arriving on different trucks (threads).
*   If that next station is *another* dispatcher (`publishOn` after `flatMap`), it will take the products off the incoming trucks and put them onto *its own* designated trucks (threads) for further processing.

So, the scheduler specified *inside* the `flatMap` mapping function dictates the execution context for that
