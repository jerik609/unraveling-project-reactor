## Is Signal Processing Tied to a Specific Thread?



### From Gemini

Generally, **no**, the processing of a single signal (like `onNext`) is not guaranteed to stay on the same thread throughout an entire reactive chain by default. The thread context can change.

Here's how it typically works:

1.  **Initial Thread:** Processing begins on a specific thread. This could be:
    *   The thread where the source publisher (e.g., `Flux.range`, `Mono.just`, `Flux.create`) started emitting.
    *   The thread dictated by an upstream `subscribeOn` operator, which influences where the source emission begins.

2.  **Operator Execution (Default):** Each operator in the chain typically receives the signal on the thread it arrived on from the previous step and executes its logic **on that same thread**. It then passes the result (or the original signal) downstream on that thread.

3.  **`publishOn` Operator (The Changer):** This is the key operator that explicitly **changes** the thread context.
    *   When a signal passes through a `publishOn(scheduler)`, that operator ensures that all subsequent operators *downstream* from it will receive and process signals on a thread provided by that specific `scheduler`.

4.  **Merging Operators (`flatMap`, `merge`, etc.):**
    *   Operators like `flatMap` subscribe to multiple inner publishers. These inner publishers might run on different threads (due to their own `subscribeOn` or `publishOn`, or the influence of an upstream `subscribeOn`).
    *   `flatMap` receives results from these inner publishers **on the threads those inner publishers used to emit**.
    *   It then forwards these merged signals downstream **on the threads they arrived on**. The thread context can therefore vary for different signals passing through the `flatMap` output, until potentially standardized by a subsequent `publishOn`.

**In essence:**

*   Processing tends to stay on the same thread *between* operators **unless** a `publishOn` operator is encountered.
*   `publishOn` explicitly shifts the execution context for all downstream operations.
*   `subscribeOn` influences the *starting* thread context for the source emission and subscription.
*   Merging operators can introduce results arriving on different threads based on their inner sources.

So, while a signal might travel across several operators on the same thread, its thread affinity isn't guaranteed for the whole chain unless you carefully control it using scheduling operators like `publishOn`.

### My note

So generally:

* the signal is processed by the operator on the same thread it arrives on, unless modified (by publishOn and subscribeOn)
* the signal is forwarded on the same thread it was executed in the operator

What I observed is that when using flatmap with inner publishers defined as "Mono.fromCallable & publishOn" or "Mono.fromFuture" (i.e. "parallel flatMap"):
* the callable is executed on thread A from the publishOn's scheduler (or fork-join pool for the future version)
* and maintains this thread throughout the execution of the inner publisher
* but when it's passed downstream, sometimes the thread changes (though Scheduler defined within flatMap  is still respected)

So the thread affinity might change when using flatMap with for some unknown reason.

This is a bit unexpected as generally, the thread should not change, as this is expensive, but flatMap does so.

THREAD AFFINITY IS WEIRD AND WE SHOULD NOT ASSUME IT ... maybe in the future I will unravel this.
